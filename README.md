# Professional README.md Generator

## Description
My motivation was to create an automated tool that can take user input and generate readme documentation files.
I built this project because I am faced with having to create documentation for my projects every time I create something new and I needed a tool to streamline my workflow.
The app solves the problem of having to research for the correct file structure and other nice to haves such as a table of contents and badges for the technologies used in the making of your project.
I learned that node.js is a very powerful automation tool and that is essential to run server-side applications.
What makes my project stand out is that it solves a real world problem that many developers face every time they finish a new project.
